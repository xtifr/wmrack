.SH NAME
\fBwmrack\fP \- CD Player and Mixer dock applet
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wmrack
[options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBwmrack\fP is a combined CD player and Audio Mixer designed to be
used with WindowMaker's dock. It can also be used with other window
managers, and can be swallowed by a variety of tools, such as fvwm's
button bar or gnome's panel.
\fBwmrack\fP handles mounted volumes, opens and closes the tray, can
display the current position in various ways and skips also data tracks.
It gives you access to all your mixer devices, so that you may change
volume or balance and set the record source.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-b\fP \fBCOLSPEC\fP or \fB\*=background\fP \fBCOLSPEC\fP
Specifies the background color of the LED. It is available through the symbolic
XPM colorname
.I led_color_black.
.Sp
The other colors of the LED can be changed using the \fB-l\fP option.
.Sp
To find out what colors are available, try
.I showrgb
(part of X11).
.TP
\fB\-d\fP \fBDEVICE\fP or \fB\*=device\fP \fBDEVICE\fP
Sets the CD-ROM device. This defaults to /dev/cdrom.
.TP
\fB\-h\fP or  \fB\*=help\fP
Prints a summary of supported options and their default values.
.TP
\fB\-l\fP \fBCOLSPEC\fP or \fB\*=ledcolor\fP \fBCOLSPEC\fP
Specifies the color of the led. It is darkened two times (for a total of
three colors) to get all needed colors. So better use a bright color.
.Sp
For the design of own XPM, the ledcolor is made available through the use
of the symbolic xpm color names
.I led_color_high,
.I led_color_low,
and
.I led_color_med.
There is also a symbol named
.I led_color_back
to get the default background color of the led\-display. It can be changed
using the \fB-l\fP option.
.Sp
To find out what colors are available, try
.I showrgb
(part of X11).
.TP
\fB\-m\fP \fBDEVICE\fP or \fB\*=mixer\fP \fBDEVICE\fP
Sets the MIXER device. This defaults to /dev/mixer.
.TP
\fB\-p\fP or \fB\*=noprobe\fP
This option disables the startup probing for a cd. Default is to probe the
cdrom. This will close the tray and read the TOC of the cd (if there is one).
.TP
\fB\-s\fP \fBSTYLEFILE\fP or \fB\*=style\fP \fBSTYLEFILE\fP
.B wmrack
will try to load its window\-pixmaps from the specified
.B STYLEFILE.
It will search this file for XPM pixmaps named
.I cdnodisc,
.I cdplaying,
.I cdpaused,
.I cdstopped,
.I cdled,
.I mixer,
and
.I mixled.
If some of those are not defined, the compile\-time defaults will be used.
.TP
\fB\-w\fP or \fB\*=withdrawn\fP
Starts the
.B wmrack
in withdrawn window state. This is useful to dock the window to
.B WindowMaker.
.TP
\fB\-M\fP \fBMODESTRING\fP or \fB\*=mode\fP \fBMODESTRING\fP
By default
.B wmrack
will startup showing the CDROM controls. With this option you can specify what 
controls should be shown. Valid \fBMODESTRINGS\FP are
.I cdrom,
and
.I mixer.
.SH INVOCATION
\fBwmrack\fP can be called using different ways. The most common invocation
is from your dock file:
.Sp
        wmrack
        WMRack
        \fIPOSITION\fP 2 \-1 0
        wmrack
        \-\-withdrawn
.Sp
Another way to call \fBwmrack\fP is to swallow it into the \fBafterstep(1)\fP
\fBWharf(1)\fP. This is best done placing the following line into your
\fI.steprc\fP:
.Sp
	*Wharf WMRack nil Swallow "wmrack" wmrack &
.Sp
This method will also work for other button\-bars, such as the
\fBFvwmButtons(1)\fP of the \fBfvwm(1)\fP window manager.
.SH GENERAL USAGE
The \fBwmrack\fP features a simple click interface. All times the buttons will
show a standard sign which specifies the action it will do. But there are some
noteable extensions to that explained below.
.Sp
You can always change the controls shown by clicking the middle button (this
is the one which shows a disc or a speaker) of the controls. This button will
show a symbol of the controls you can change to by pressing it (the disc and
the speaker).
.Sp
If you click this button with Control-Button-3, \fBWMrack\fP will exit.
.SH CDROM USAGE
The default behavior of \fBwmrack\fP is to try to read the cdrom at
startup. If there was no cd, it will not try again unless you press the close
or play button. This will close the cdrom and again try to read it. Unless
there is a cd, \fBwmrack\fP will again suspend until your next action.
.TP
