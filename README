wmrack 1.4

The WindowMaker Sound Control Panel by Oliver Graf
Currently maintained by Chris Waters <xtifr@users.sourceforge.net>
See http://wmrack.sourceforge.net for the latest news and updates.


DESCRIPTION:
------------
WMRack is a Dock/Wharf applet which gives you complete control over
your CDROM, the Mixer and hopefully in the future to other sound related
stuff (feel free to send suggestions).

It's main advantage is the high configurability, which will let you specify
different looks for the window at startup.

CD-Functions:
 * Display Track and Time (remaining/to-go, track/total)
 * Play, Pause, Stop, Eject, Load, Track +/-, Fast Fore-/Back-ward
 * Display of total tracks and length when a new CD is loaded
 * random play, skip data tracks, play lists

Mixer Functions:
 * startup options for initial volume
 * control all your mixer devices
 * control balance
 * change record sources

Currently supported platforms are: Linux (stable), Solaris
(experimental) and FreeBSD (experimental).

INSTALLATION:
-------------
First you need to configure the whole package with:

./configure (see './configure --help' for options)

Now you can make a link in XPM to the style you want compiled into
WMRack using 'ln -s A.style standart.style' or do nothing for the
default.

After this a 'make' will compile WMRack and a 'make install' will
install it.

Special note to Solaris users: Solaris support is new as-of release
1.4, and it should be considered somewhat experimental.  You will
probably need to install the OSS drivers from www.opensound.com before
configuring/installing (although future versions of OpenSolaris may
incorporate OSS, so you might be able to skip this step).

USAGE:
------
Look into the manpage for supported options and functions.

Easily swallowed by dock (use the --withdrawn option).

Putting wmrack into AfterStep Wharf:
*Wharf WMRack nil Swallow "wmrack" wmrack &


BUGS & CONTACT:
---------------
The author, Oliver Graf, is no longer supporting or maintaining WMRack,
therefore, all bug reports or suggestions should be sent to the current
maintainer, Chris Waters <xtifr@users.sourceforge.net> or submitted at
the new web page: http://wmrack.sourceforge.net 

Include a description how the bug can be reproduced plus the vendor
and model of your cdrom and/or soundcard. Also include a debug log
(configure with --with-debug -- this is the default for beta versions)
created with your bug-reproduction-recipe.

Send new styles or style questions to xtifr@users.sourceforge.net

Oliver may no longer support the program, but if you'd like to tell him
that you appreciate his work, you can email ograf@fga.de

HISTORY:
--------
Basically this thing borrowed much from WorkBone, ascd and asmixer. But in
the progress of work, almost any part that was stolen, has been rewritten,
restructured, and overworked.
